# GitHub Finder

Udemy course project to learn React

## Live Demo

[GitHub Finder](https://github-finder-chi-ten.vercel.app/)

## Details

A React app to search for GitHub profiles and check their details.

It is a part of the [React Front to Back Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-front-to-back-2022/).

I've also made some adjustments for the styling and responsivness of the app on smaller screens.

Later on I've made another application like this to search for crypto currencies: [repo](https://github.com/Dimterion/Finder-app), [live demo](https://finder-app-tau.vercel.app/).

## Built with

React, React Router, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI, Prettier
